    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>Best of Best of the Worst is a fan-made site where you decide which videos from RedLetterMedia’s
        <em>Best of the Worst</em> will crush / cut / burn / mildly inconvenience all the others.</p>

    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>You get two videos chosen (mostly) at random, drawn from past <em>Best of the Worst</em> episodes. You choose
        which one you think is better. Over time, the system builds a crowdsourced ranking of all the choices.</p>
    <p>Rankings use a
        <a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html">Wilson score interval</a>. This
        helps avoid over-ranking a video that, for example, only got one vote.
    </p>

    <h1>What’s stored?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Your votes are tied to a random, anonymous ID — no names or emails. The ID is used to prevent
            accidental double voting.
        </li>
        <li>Only the pairs you’ve voted on are saved.</li>
        <li>No tracking, no ads, no analytics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Why did you build this?</h1>
    <p>I enjoy <em>Best of the Worst</em> a lot. It's given me great entertainment for many years. One day I
        wondered what it would look like to pick the best of the best. Since it would be a war crime to make the RLM
        crew decide this themselves, I decided to outsource the suffering to you, the viewer.</p>
